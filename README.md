# Custom Real Estate Chatbot

This Python script utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo to create a custom chatbot tailored for real estate purposes. The bot assists in the process of selling houses by providing information about various properties.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following:

- Python environment set up with necessary dependencies.
- An OpenAI API key. If you don't have one, sign up at [OpenAI](https://openai.com).
- Basic understanding of working with virtual environments.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your_repository
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On MacOS or Linux:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

5. Install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Setting up API Key

1. Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory.

2. Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:

    ```plaintext
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
